                <h1>Care to compare</h1>
                <p>Understanding and comparing benefits of insurance policies can often cause consumers more confusion
                    than clarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2021 we looked to improve the major decision point of our online quote and sale journey to assist
                    customers in comparing cover to ensure they select the right insurer for them.

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    In the 20 years since its Australian launch, Budget Direct Insurance has grown to become one of the
                    biggest challengers in the Australian Insurance market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As insurance becomes more complicated customers look for more ways to make sense of all the
                    inclusions and exclusions, and the cost verses the benefits of each policy. That creates a need to
                    ensure their main decision point, the price page, provides them with their ideal customer
                    experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project our goal was to improve the conversion rate of this main decision point, in addition
                    to reducing the need for customers to contact us for clarification.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Scope and constraints
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Due to development team scheduling our scope was restricted to meaningful changes we could make on
                    this specific page.
                </p>

                    For this project I worked as a UX researcher during the research and discovery phase, as well as
                    part of the UI team on the design.

                <h2>The Approach</h2>

                <h3>Kick off</h3>

                <h4>
                    Understanding 20 years of Insurance
                </h4>
                <p>
                    At the outset of the project we knew a lot about how customers historically interacted with this
                    page, but not a lot about what todays customers actual want from it.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Early insights
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Armed with an arsenal of data, we poured through customer chats, phone calls, feedback surveys and
                    complaints forms to understand the current landscape and where we were weakest. What we found:
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Customers skim. A lot.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    We assumed that customers read what we presented to them. We were wrong. Purchasing insurance is a
                    necessity, not a delight. As such, we found that customers skimmed the journey just enough to answer
                    the questions, but became frustrated if they couldn't find answers to their own questions easily.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Customers aren't sure what they want covered.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Most customers haven't had to claim for Home Insurance, so they don't know what they actually want
                    to be covered for. They just want the best value for money.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Customers want to easily compare policies across companies.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    They want us to tell them where we fall short and where we exceed other companies so they can decide
                    what is valuable to themselves, and what they can live without.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Don't waste my time.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Customers don't want their valuable time wasted on things they consider pointless, such as awards,
                    marketing etc. they want us to get straight to the point so they can get it over and done with.

                    “How might we improve the likelihood of customers to continue past the price page without changing
                    product pricing?”

                <h3>Defining success</h3>
                <p>
                    At the end of the day success for the business is an increase is genuine sales, without an increase
                    in cancellations. This goes hand in hand with the customers goal of purchasing a policy that is
                    right for them, without the price tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the UX team our goal was to improve customer understanding on this key decision point in the
                    journey. By doing so, we should see an increase in genuine customers and a decrease is confused
                    customers purchasing a policy that wasn’t right for them, and then needing to cancel via the contact
                    centre.

                <h3>Reframing the problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Competitor analysis informed us that we were already very competitive in the price space, and
                    benefits were typically the same across different brands. We could only assume that brand perception
                    and the information and language throughout our journey contributed to a perception that our product
                    or brand is inferior to competitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this knowledge we decided to reframe the problem to highlight that our need was now: “How might
                    we better inform customers of the benefits of our policies without overloading the quote process?”

                <h3>How we tested</h3>

                <h4>The three big questions</h4>
                <p>
                    Three major questions informed my design strategy for this project:
                <ol>
                    <li>How do you design for everyone? </li>
                    <li>What is the most valuable information according to the users?</li>
                    <li>What would make them continue?</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <h5>
                    What do you want from me?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    It was important for us to understand the why behind what the users were saying in our early
                    insights. We knew what they thought they wanted, but why did they want it? Could we solve their
                    concerns in a better way?
                </p>

                </p>
                <h5>
                    What is all this?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The existing Price page was a jumble of insurance lingo, legally required disclosures, marketing
                    pitches and a list of what you’ve already answered. Where was the value for our customers?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to understand what customers were actually looking for we needed to speak to actual
                    customers.
                </p>

                <h5>
                    How does the need differ across our diverse customers?
                </h5>

                <p>
                    We used Brisbane based recruitment agency Askable to find participants for in person interviews for
                    our Home Quote journey. We selected participants that covered a wide range of our home owner user
                    base. From young to old, first time and seasoned insurance purchasers, across all genders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We know from data that 54% of our customers use mobile devices, so we tested half our participants
                    on mobile while the other half used desktop to ensure we weren’t missing device specific problems.
