                <p>Understanding and comparing benefits of insurance policies can often cause consumers more confusion
                    than clarity.

                    In 2021 we looked to improve the major decision point of our online quote and sale journey to assist
                    users in comparing cover to ensure they select the right insurer for them.

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    In the 20 years since its Australian launch, Budget Direct Insurance has grown to become one of the
                    biggest challengers in the Australian Insurance market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As insurance becomes more complicated users look for more ways to make sense of all the
                    inclusions and exclusions, and the cost verses the benefits of each policy. That creates a need to
                    ensure their main decision point, the price page, provides them with their ideal user
                    experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project our goal was to <mark>improve the conversion rate</mark> of this main decision
                    point, in addition
                    to <mark>reducing the need for users to contact us </mark> for clarification.

                    Due to development team scheduling our scope was restricted to meaningful changes we could make on

                <p>
                    At the outset of the project we knew a lot about how users historically interacted with this
                    page, but not a lot about what todays users actual want from it.

                <p>
                    Armed with an arsenal of data, we poured through user chats, phone calls, feedback surveys
                    and
                    complaints forms to understand the current landscape and where we were weakest. What we found:

                    <p>
                        We assumed that users read what we presented to them. We were wrong. Purchasing
                        insurance is a
                        necessity, not a delight. As such, we found that users skimmed the journey just
                        enough to answer
                        the questions, but became frustrated if they couldn't find answers to their own
                        questions easily.

                        Most users haven't had to claim for Home Insurance, so they don't know what they
                        actually want
                        to be covered for. They just want the best value for money.

                <p>
                    Competitor analysis informed us that we were already very competitive in the price space, and
                    benefits were typically the same across different brands. We could only assume that brand perception
                    and the information and language throughout <mark>our journey contributed to a perception that our
                        product
                        or brand is inferior to competitors.</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this knowledge we decided to reframe the problem to highlight that our need was now:

                <br>
                <blockquote>

                <p>
                    Three major questions informed my design strategy for this project:
                <ol>
                    <li>How do you design for everyone? </li>
                    <li>What is the most valuable information according to the users?</li>
                    <li>What would make them continue?</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                </h4>
                <p>
                    It was important for us to understand the why behind what the users were saying in our early
                    insights. <mark>We knew what they thought they wanted, but why did they want it?</mark> Could we
                    solve their
                    concerns in a better way?

                </h4>
                <p>
                    The existing price page was a jumble of insurance lingo, legally required disclosures, marketing
                    pitches and a list of what you've already answered. Where was the value for our users?

                <p>
                    <mark> In order to understand what users were actually looking for we needed to speak to actual

                    How does the need differ across our diverse users?

                <p>
                    We used Brisbane based recruitment agency Askable to find participants for in person interviews for
                    our Home Quote journey. We selected participants that covered a wide range of our home owner user
                    base. From young to old, first time and seasoned insurance purchasers, across all genders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We know from data that 54% of our users use mobile devices, so we tested half our participants
                    on mobile while the other half used desktop to ensure we weren't missing device specific problems.

            <div class="article-inner narrow">
                <h2>The process</h2>
                <p>We asked participants to complete a <mark>three part moderated user interview</mark>, which followed
                    this
                    structure:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Introductions and background on the participants demographic</li>
                    <li>Get a quote (to provide context to the price page and tease out the type of user they
                        are)</li>
                    <li>Think and comment on the current price pages successes and misses</li>
                    <li>Compare and contrast to the new price page design</li>
                    <li>Paper prototype build their ideal price page</li>
                    <li>Card sort to prioritize benefits</li>
                </ol>



                <h3>STEP 1: Introductions</h3>
                <p>We introduce the UX researchers and ask the participant to tell us a bit about themselves, giving
                    them time to become more comfortable with the facilitators. This also gives us valuable insights
                    into the type of purchaser they might be, and what they value from an insurance policy.</p>
                <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/dddddd/000000">

                <h3>STEP 2: Get a quote</h3>

                <p>The participant demonstrates how they would typically find, compare and purchase an insurance
                    policy. This might be through Google, a comparison website, or direct to a brand they know. We
                    observed their research process and what information was truly valuable to them.</p>
                <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/dddddd/000000">

                <h3>STEP 3: Current state price page</h3>
                <p>We ask the participant to pause their journey at the price page and take a deeper look. We have
                    some probing questions ready for any participants that have trouble thinking out loud, for
                    example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What do you like about this page? What do you dislike?</li>
                    <li>What is missing from this page?</li>
                    <li>Is there anything you would remove all together?</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/dddddd/000000">
                <h3>STEP 4: Compare and contrast</h3>
                <p>We show the participant an interactive prototype of the new design of this page and ask them to
                    repeat the previous step.</p>
                <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/dddddd/000000">

                <h3>STEP 5: Paper prototyping</h3>
                <p>After seeing both versions of the page and hearing their thoughts, we ask the participant to
                    craft their ideal price page with the pieces of the original designs, as well as sticky notes
                    for anything new they'd like to add.</p>
                <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/dddddd/000000">

                <h3>STEP 6: Prioritizing benefits</h3>
                <p>We asked the participants to perform some card sorting in order to prioritise which benefits mean
                    more to them. We also asked that they leave out any benefits they simply do not care about at
                    all.</p>

                        users want us to care about them. They want to see through the UI that we care about their
                        circumstances, and that we had taken every unique part of them into consideration. They want to
                        know
                        they aren't just a number, and they want us to take the time to explain the minutia of the
                        policy to
                        them, if they so choose.

                    <p>
                        That begs the question, how do you serve a user without knowing what kind of user they
                        are? How can you hold the hand of a first time purchaser, but reduce friction of an experienced
                        purchaser?

                    <h4>
                        You know I don't understand.

                    <p>
                        From existing data we know that users don't understand or misinterpret the “legal stuff” of
                        an
                        insurance policy, and those are typically key to a claim being approved. users want to
                        understand their policy, but we make it too hard for them by hiding behind legal terms and
                        confusing
                        names.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We know that users don't understand these terms, but the industry standard is to use them
                        anyway
                        to cover ourselves in case of legal issues. So why don't we listen to users when they tell
                        us
                        they don't understand? Why can't we use more human friendly text to truly explain the policy to
                        our
                        users, instead of accepting that it's too hard, or not our problem?

                    <p>
                        The full list of benefits (that we incorrectly assumed would be a positive) actually overwhelmed
                        participants. They're telling us they want to know everything they're covered for, but when we
                        give
                        it to them, it's too much. How might we group or consolidate the benefits to convey how much is
                        covered without overwhelming the users?

                        paying.
                        This is a huge misconception, as more than half the journey is still to come, with almost all
                        pages
                        having an impact on price. How can we convey to users that this is an indicative price, but
                        they've still got more to go?

                <h2>The impact</h2>

                <p>
                    Due to time constraints within the Home Product team we pivoted to test the Car Product first. Our
                    internal A/B test team ran a 50/50 test using the updated new design against the current version for
                    the Car Product and we saw some significant wins, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduction in % Offline Sales resulting from online quotes (-16.4%)</li>
                    <li>Increase in % Agreed Value sales (+14.5%)</li>
                    <li>Increase in add-ons (% Hire Car Option +5.5%, % Choice of Repairer +9.4, % Windscreen Cover
                        +3.2%)</li>
                </ul>


                <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x300/dddddd/000000">

                <h3>It wasn't all good news</h3>
                <p>We did see an increase in the number of users selecting an annual payment frequency (+3.8%), and
                    a larger percentage of those users leaving before purchasing. We attributed this change to the
                    new design defaulting to annual payment frequencies instead of requiring a selection.
                </p>

                <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x300/dddddd/000000">

                <h3>Run it back</h3>
                <p>To confirm this theory, we ran another A/B test. This time we tested the new design against an
                    updated version that required the user to select a payment frequency. The results showed the updated
                    design increased conversion but had no impact on the prior positive results.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We have a winner.</p>
