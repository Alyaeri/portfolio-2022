                    In 2019 we looked to improve the security of our online self service platform by providing a more
                    secure login system that didn't punish infrequent users of the platform, while also eliminating a
                    barrier to entry by removing the password requirement altogether.

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal for this project was to increase the number of successful logins through the online policy
                    management platform by reducing barriers to entry. In turn, this would contribute to solving a
                    business need by reducing the number of users calling to make changes to their policy.

                <p>
                    When we were handed this project some level of solutionising had already been completed, namely with
                    the security and infrastructure teams to determine feasibility. <mark>The security team determined
                        that
                        SMS was the most secure method of sending a OTP (one-time pin)</mark>, and as such that was the
                    <mark>only method
                        we would be proceeding with.</mark> This would become one of the most controversial decisions of
                    the
                    project.

                <p>
                    At the outset of the project we didn't have any existing insights into the current journey, so we
                    were unable to form clear goals. Our first task was to understand how users perceive the current
                    journey, fortunately we have access to an abundance of data at our fingertips.

                    Early insights
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I analyzed themes of data across many of our user feedback platforms to form an early picture of
                    our users opinion of the current journey. From surveys, live chats, call recording, and contact
                    forms we formed a picture of a login that <mark>according to our users either “just works” or
                        “never
                        works”.</mark> Some common themes included:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Clunky password reset process</li>
                    <li>Difficult to navigate and non responsive UI built without mobile in mind (which now makes up
                        over 50% of our sales)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We needed to dive deeper to understand why the login was smooth for some users, and incredibly
                    frustrating to other users.

                    Given our challenge is to increase the number of successful logins, our definition of success for
                    this project directly relates to this metric. OTPs are a relatively new way to login, so we
                    understand there is an education piece within this project that would only be solved with time as
                    users grow more familiar with the system. Therefore, our measures of success were:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Increasing the number of successful logins to the online policy management platform</li>
                    <li>Without greatly increasing the number of users chatting or calling for assistance</li>
                    <li>Determining the best time to disable the legacy email and password login</li>
                    <li>Increasing the overall NPS of the login system</li>

                <h3>How we tested</h3>
                <p>
                    A user research project typically calls for multiple rounds of testing to iterate over designs and
                    validate changes. We knew early on that this project would require <mark> more complex iterative
                        testing </mark>
                    that would depend on <mark>our ability to capture and review data from our production
                        environment</mark> before
                    making changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we wanted to know:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Can users use the new login with SMS authentication?</li>
                    <li>What would improve the new login experience?</li>
                    <li>What barriers to entry could be identified? (no signal, phone dead, old phone number)</li>
                </ol>

                    User feedback analysis

                <p>
                    To form a more in-depth picture of the current state I returned to analyzing feedback from existing
                    users. This time I dove deeper than just general themes and started to log specific reasons for
                    users failing to login.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We quickly found that:

                <p>
                    Before jumping into design I spent some time reading existing user research in the
                    authentication space. I familarised myself with the common themes and findings from these articles

                    a more user friendly experience with as little friction as possible.</p>

                <p>One of our first questions was whether the call to action to login on budgetdirect.com.au was working
                    as we intended. <mark> We ran an A/B test to determine if the “Policy Manager login” button text was
                        the
                        most effective call to action.</mark> In the first round we tested a number of different

                <ul>
                    <li>Control: “Policy manager login”</li>
                    <li>Variant 1: “Manage your account”</li>
                    <li>Variant 2: “Login”</li>
                    <li>Variant 3: “Existing user login”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We ran this test for 2 weeks and <mark>quickly determined variant 2 was the most successful

                    After seeing the success of the “login” variant we iterated. Now knowing that users prefer clear
                    and concise labels, <mark>we tested “login” against a “sign in” call to action.</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over a 30 day test <mark>we confirmed our earlier findings,</mark> that “login” was the preferred

                    we asked users to imagine they were a user of Budget Direct and wanted to manage their policy
                    online. </p>

                <h4>Recruitment</h4>
                <p>
                    We used Brisbane based recruitment platform Askable to screen and recruit 6 participants
                    representing an array of demographics that represent our typical user base. We split the tests
                    across both mobile and desktop to get a true representation of how our users typically interact
                    with
                    out platforms.
                </p>

                <h4>Set up</h4>

                <p>
                    I translated the prototype from AdobeXD into Axure to give the participants a truly interactive
                    experience with our prototype. Axure allows us to capture and process information entered, so
                    <mark>we
                        were able to provide a real representation of what the finished product would look and feel
                        like. </mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the purposes of the test we mocked up a mobile phone with an example of an authentication
                    SMS
                    that a user might receive. We provided the mock up as a paper print out and asked the
                    user
                    to image they had received the SMS on their personal mobile phone.

                <h4>Test</h4>
                <p>
                    We followed a typical moderated user testing format
                </p>
                <ol>

                    <li>Introduction and rapport building</li>
                    <li>Set the scene - “you need to make a car insurance claim right now, what would you do?”</li>
                    <li>Observe</li>
                    <li>Once the user found the login button we switched to a prototype and let them continue</li>
                    <li>After their successful login we wrapped this section up with some questions around their general
                        sentiment towards to process
                        <ul>
                            <li>What did you think of the process?</li>
                            <li>Would you use it? If not what would make you want to use it?</li>
                            <li>How secure do you think it is? Why?</li>
                            <li>Do you feel secure using your phone number for identification?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>The outcome</h4>
                <p>

                <ul>
                    <li><mark>No one had a problem!</mark></li>
                    <li>Everyone got through with no errors</li>
                    <li>They recognised the PIN process from other websites eg. Banking</li>
                    <li>Generally, they didn't have any security concerns</li>
                    <li>People generally didn't notice the difference between the fist login and the second</li>
                    <li>Because people enter from different places there is an opportunity to make the process
                        smoother by personalising the title (eg: claiming, maintain their policy)</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

             

                <h4>Gather and prioritise</h4>
                <p>With a growing collection of information from user feedback analysis as well as user
                    testing <mark>we began to group themes amongst our findings and prioritized them based on the impact
                        to the user journey.</mark> We emphasized the problems that would completely prevent users from
                    logging in, as they went against our earlier defined goals. </p>

                <h4>Present to the business</h4>
                <p>From there we presented our findings back to the business, providing key stakeholders with
                    much
                    needed insights into the new journey and our findings. <mark>We recommended changes and important
                        pieces of work that should be completed prior to go-live.</mark> Armed with this information,
                    the
                    business decided to move forward with their current solution, regardless of our findings.
                </p>
                <p>The business also wanted to decommission the legacy email and password login in tandem with
                    the
                    release of the OTP login. <mark>We strongly advised against this</mark> as we had no idea how
                    successful
                    the
                    new OTP login would be, and how dependent users would be on this legacy login. We
                    suggested
                    monitoring the success rate and impact on chat periodically to determine when our users
                    would be ready for such a change, to which the business agreed.</p>

                <p>We began to monitor the success of the OTP login, and through A/B test we periodically assessed the
                    impact of removing the legacy login.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Test 2 (08/2020): -23.9% successful logins, +28% increase in chats</li>

                        login,</mark>
                    seeing from these results that we would not be adversely affecting the login rate, or increase the
