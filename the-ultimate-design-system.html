                    our web platforms took off the business began expanding into other insurance products, which
                    included expanding the teams in order to scale rapidly. With this expansion we lost the strict

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    As we reflect a number of years later, <mark>we can see that the rapid expansion left us with the
                        illusion of consistency,</mark> when in reality it was all but. We had products that had copied
                    the
                    library (not
                    branched) so far in the past that they were no longer compatible for updates, as well as many with
                    styling overrides and fixes that only applied to their own version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Design System project <mark>aims to unify all the products into one manageable ecosystem</mark>,
                    paving the
                    way for updates across the whole system that enables us to <mark>meet our goal of AA web
                        accessibility
                        standards.</mark>
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Scope and constraints
                </h3>
                <p>
                    8 products, many with over 100 pages, and endless bespoke UIs that needed to be inventoried and
                    consolidated. On top of that, our products are white labeled and sold as other brands, so we needed
                    to enable enough configuration and customization to match the look and feel of 12 partner brands.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    My role
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I spearheaded this project as the lead UI designer, as well as the UX and web accessibility
                    champion. For this project I worked closely with both the Research & Development team, as well as
                    the dev teams.

                <h2>The Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    First came the painstaking process of sifting through hundreds and hundreds of pages of UI across 8
                    very different insurance apps to identify and screenshot every element we used. Every variance was
                    captured, from an extra icon here, to a different font size there. I saved it all.
                </p>

                        alt="A sceenshot of a number of existing component states">
                    <figcaption>Current state components</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>
                    Group.
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Armed with hundreds of unique UI elements I began to group them into categories. Seeing them all
                    side by side truly highlighted our need for a design system, <mark>how could we ever manage all of
                        these
                        apps when they were all so varied?</mark> We had to unify, and these were our candidate
                    components.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img class="border" src="images/case-studies/case-study-2/img_cs2-group.png"
                        alt="A screenshot of a number of button component existing states">
                    <figcaption>Current state of the button component</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h3>Consolidate.</h3>

                <p>Using these categories I began to build a landscape of what components we would actually need across
                    all our apps. Identifying bespoke UIs that could be catered to with another component we had already
                    used elsewhere. <mark>I began to trim the fat.</mark></p>

                <figure>
                    <img class="border" src="images/case-studies/case-study-2/img_cs2-consolidate.png"
                        alt="A screenshot of the to be button component structure">
                    <figcaption>Consolidated button component with new structure</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Consider.</h3>

                <p>At this point I began to consider not only what we could remove, but what we might add as well. This
                    was our opportunity to redefine our UI and build more flexibility into what was currently a very
                    inflexible design system.</p>

                <p>I am a big advocate for accessible design, and <mark>this felt like the perfect opportunity to push
                        for
                        inclusive design within our ecosystem.</mark> If we were rebuilding the UI from scratch, why not
                    make it
                    accessible while we're at it? After all, accessible design isn't just for the disabled or impaired,
                    it sets the standard for a UI with hierarchy and purpose, that is accessible for everyone. And when
                    you're in an industry that serves the general population, you need to understand and design for the
                    complexity that comes with every unique human.</p>

                <p>
                    Success was measuring differently across the teams invested in the design system.
                </p>

                <h4>For the design team</h4>
                <p>
                    For the design team success meant having a design system we could lean on to facilitate <mark>rapid
                        prototyping.</mark> It also gave us a tool to push back on business requests for bespoke UIs by
                    asking them
                    to <mark>quantify the value</mark> in the extra development time.
                </p>

                <h4>For the development team</h4>
                <p>For the development teams, success meant <mark>reducing the time they spent on front end work</mark>
                    by leveraging
                    reusable components to rapidly build web screens. It also allowed the QA testers to <mark>verify UIs
                        without involving a designer.</mark></p>


                <h4>For the business</h4>
                <p>For the business success meant having <mark>less tech stacks to manage and maintain, allowing for
                        faster
                        development time</mark> and a more consistent look and feel. It also meant adding the
                    functionality to
                    allow us to truly white label our products, and <mark>use our newly found AA standard as a selling
                        point </mark>
                    in conversations with proposed partners.</p>

                    processes and systems to manage design at scale. As such, we needed to think beyond just the UI,
                    widening our scope to <mark>set the standard for our design system as a whole.</mark> Our goals
                    became:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Reusable components</li>
                    <li>Meets AA web accessibility standards</li>
                    <li>Cohesive with our existing brochureware website</li>

                <h2>The solution</h2>

                <p>With our widened scope in mind I began researching Component Library structures, how might we hang
                    together our huge number of components in a flexible pattern that reduces complexity but enables us
                    to maintain some very intricate components? <mark>We needed a universal language that both the
                        designers
                        and developers could speak.</mark></p>

                <p>I quickly found <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design by Brad
                        Frost</a> and it truly resonated with me. In his blog he explains that “Atomic design is a
                    methodology for creating design systems. There are five distinct levels in atomic design:”</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Atoms,</b> the basic building blocks of matter</li>
                    <li><b>Molecules,</b> groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a
                        compound.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Organisms,</b> groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct
                        section of
                        an interface.</li>
                    <li><b>Templates,</b> which consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Pages,</b> are specific instances of templates</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The concept being that every component in our library could be broken down until they became atoms.
                    Conversely, every intricate component could be built on a foundation of atoms and molecules. Atomic
                    Design has become our foundation for the design system, with every component assigned a relative
                    level based on their practical implementation. </p>

                    With a design system locked in and a process in place, I pushed forward with painstakingly creating
                    60+ components (and growing all the time!) in AdobeXD. Many components require designs for each of
                    their potential states (for example, :active, :hover, :disabled, :focus), which resulted in hundreds
                    of designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a lot. A lot.

                <p>
                    My major goal for this project was to meet AA Web Accessibility Standards. As a modern business that
                    caters to the masses it's truly disgraceful that we weren't already meeting these basic web
                    standards. I advocated hard to include the requirement to meet AA standards in our design system
                    project. I was able to convince my manager and associate director of the value we would create, and
                    got the green light to build towards AA standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a business perspective meeting AA standards will always be a positive when working with our
                    partner brands, as it can only aid in making our UI easier to use.

                <p>
                    In the past each team has handled developer handover differently, making the designers job more
                    complex than it needed to be. By migrating to Zeplin we have <mark>streamlined the developer
                        handover by
                        providing detailed specifications</mark> at the touch of a button. With Zeplins 'Connected
                    Components' we were
                    able to link components it a prototype directly to the real component in Storybook, <mark>taking
                        away the
                        guesswork and explicitly telling developers exactly which component to use.</mark>

                <h3>Facilitating UI testing </h3>

                <p>Another perk of the design system was its ability to facilitate UI testing through manual and
                    automated testing.</p>



                <h4>Automated testing</h4>
                <p>BackstopJS has been a godsend for the Component library. It completes <mark>automated visual
                        regression
                        testing</mark> for UIs across configured devices and operating systems to prevent unintended
                    changes being
                    pushed to the Component Library. This is significantly reduced the amount of UI sign off the design
                    team needs to complete, and removes us as a bottleneck to development of components.</p>

                <h4>Streamlining manual testing</h4>
                <p>Zeplin arms the manual test team with UI testing tools to compare the design to the built component
                    and identify gaps or mistakes before the component makes it to production. Screen overlay, detailed
                    specifications and versioning of designs means that <mark> manual testers can verify UIs on their
                        own,
                        without waiting for UI designer sign off.</mark></p>

                <h2>The impact</h2>

                <p>
                    The work is never done, and the Design System will always be evolving. However, with strong
                    processes and controls in place, alongside better working processes that reduce the overhead for the
                    teams, this Design System is here to stay.
                </p>


                <h3>For the design team</h3>
                <p>We have a design system we can rely on. We have detailed component definitions built in AdobeXD that
                    directly connect to real components in Storybook, allowing us to prototype at speeds we were never
                    capable of before. We have a resource that facilitates discussions with the business, and a process
                    that allows us to gatekeep the design system to <mark>ensure that we spend our time building
                        components
                        that genuinely deliver value.</mark>
                </p>


                <h3>For the development teams</h3>
                <p><mark>The Design System project has been a phenomenal success.</mark> Teams are seeing a huge return
                    on investment
                    by migrating to the Component Library, and new apps are all slated to be built using the new design
                    system.
                    Existing products are scheduling sprints to complete their upgrade as soon as possible, as the
                    benefits speak for themselves.</p>

                <h3>For the business</h3>
                <p>The business is starting to see a real return on investment as products migrate to the new library
                    and UI related bugs being to taper off. <mark> More technical work can be completed as teams no
                        longer need
                        to worry about maintaining the UI, giving them more time to focus on the complex stuff.</mark>
