                <p>As any business scales it finds itself adding more. More functionality, more features, more staff. As
                    our web platforms took off the business began expanding into other insurance products, which
                    included expanding the teams in order to scale rapidly. With this expansion we lost the strict

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    As we reflect a number of years later, we can see that the rapid expansion left us with the <mark>illusion
                    of consistency,</mark> when in reality it was all but. We had products that had copied the library (not
                    branched) so far in the past that they were no longer compatible for updates, as well as many with
                    styling overrides and fixes that only applied to their own version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Design System project <mark>aims to unify all the products into one manageable ecosystem</mark>, paving the
                    way for updates across the whole system that enables us to <mark>meet our goal of AA web accessibility
                    standards.</mark>
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Scope and constraints
                </h3>
                <p>
                    8 products, many with over 100 pages, and endless bespoke UIs that needed to be inventoried and
                    consolidated. On top of that, our products are white labeled and sold as other brands, so we needed
                    to enable enough configuration and customization to match the look and feel of 12 partner brands.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    My role
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I spearheaded this project as the lead UI designer, as well as the UX and web accessibility
                    champion. For this project I worked closely with both the Research & Development team, as well as
                    the dev teams.

                <h2>The Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    First came the painstaking process of sifting through hundreds and hundreds of pages of UI across 8
                    very different insurance apps to identify and screenshot every element we used. Every variance was
                    captured, from an extra icon here, to a different font size there. I saved it all.
                </p>

                <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/dddddd/000000">

                <h3>
                    Group.
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Armed with hundreds of unique UI elements I began to group them into categories. Seeing them all
                    side by side truly highlighted our need for a design system, <mark>how could we ever manage all of these
                    apps when they were all so varied?</mark> We had to unify, and these were our candidate components.
                </p>

                <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/dddddd/000000">

                <h3>Consolidate.</h3>

                <p>Using these categories I began to build a landscape of what components we would actually need across
                    all our apps. Identifying bespoke UIs that could be catered to with another component we had already
                    used elsewhere. <mark>I began to trim the fat.</mark></p>

                    <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/dddddd/000000">

                <h3>Consider.</h3>

                <p>At this point I began to consider not only what we could remove, but what we might add as well. This
                    was our opportunity to redefine our UI and build more flexibility into what was currently a very
                    inflexible design system.</p>

                <p>I am a big advocate for accessible design, and <mark>this felt like the perfect opportunity to push for
                    inclusive design within our ecosystem.</mark> If we were rebuilding the UI from scratch, why not make it
                    accessible while we're at it? After all, accessible design isn't just for the disabled or impaired,
                    it sets the standard for a UI with hierarchy and purpose, that is accessible for everyone. And when
                    you're in an industry that serves the general population, you need to understand and design for the
                    complexity that comes with every unique human.</p>

                    Success was measuring differently across the teams invested in the design system.
                </p>

                <h4>For the design team</h4>
                <p>
                    For the design team success meant having a design system we could lean on to facilitate <mark>rapid
                    prototyping.</mark> It also gave us a tool to push back on business requests for bespoke UIs by asking them
                    to <mark>quantify the value</mark> in the extra development time.
                </p>

                <h4>For the development team</h4>
                <p>For the development teams, success meant <mark>reducing the time they spent on front end work</mark> by leveraging
                    reusable components to rapidly build web screens. It also allowed the QA testers to <mark>verify UIs
                    without involving a designer.</mark></p>


                <h4>For the business</h4>
                <p>For the business success meant having <mark>less tech stacks to manage and maintain, allowing for faster
                    development time</mark> and a more consistent look and feel. It also meant adding the functionality to
                    allow us to truly white label our products, and <mark>use our newly found AA standard as a selling point </mark>
                    in conversations with proposed partners.</p>

                <p>
                    A design system is more than just a component library, it's an ecosystem. A set of principles,
                    processes and systems to manage design at scale. As such, we needed to think beyond just the UI,
                    widening our scope to <mark>set the standard for our design system as a whole.</mark> Our goals became:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Reusable components</li>
                    <li>Meets AA web accessibility standards</li>
                    <li>Cohesive with our existing brochureware website</li>
                    <li>Expands customization for white labelled partners</li>
                    <li>Facilitates more comprehensive UI testing by our manual testers</li>

                <h2>The solution</h2>

                <p>With our widened scope in mind I began researching Component Library structures, how might we hang
                    together our huge number of components in a flexible pattern that reduces complexity but enables us
                    to maintain some very intricate components? <mark>We needed a universal language that both the designers
                    and developers could speak.</mark></p>

                <p>I quickly found <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design by Brad
                        Frost</a> and it truly resonated with me. In his blog he explains that “Atomic design is a
                    methodology for creating design systems. There are five distinct levels in atomic design:”</p>

                <ol>
                    <li> Atoms, the basic building blocks of matter</li>
                    <li>Molecules, groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound.
                    </li>
                    <li>Organisms, groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of
                        an interface.</li>
                    <li>Templates, Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages.</li>
                    <li>Pages, are specific instances of templates</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The concept being that every component in our library could be broken down until they became atoms.
                    Conversely, every intricate component could be built on a foundation of atoms and molecules. Atomic
                    Design has become our foundation for the design system, with every component assigned a relative
                    level based on their practical implementation. </p>

                <h3>Creating a process</h3>

                <p>It wasn't enough to create a new library of components, we needed a defined process for the creation
                    of new components to prevent us ending up right back where we started.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Identify. When the need for a new component is identified</li>
                    <li>Evaluate. What does this component need to do? How does it differ to our existing components?
                        Could
                        it be handled by extending an existing component? </li>
                    <li>Assess. If we've determined we need to create a new component to fill this need then I will
                        assess
                        the required functionality and look for any reusable patterns we could leverage.</li>
                    <li>Create. Design and define the new component states and functionality</li>
                    <li>Review. Provide the Component library development team with a chance to review the design and
                        provide feedback on feasibility or concerns. Also gives stakeholders a chance to review the new
                        component and identify gaps.</li>
                    <li>Iterate. Repeat steps 4 – 6 until design, development and stakeholders are satisfied with the
                        proposed component.</li>
                    <li>Publish. Publish new component definition to our hosted Component Library prototype via AdobeXD.
                    </li>
                    <li>Handover. Export detailed specifications from AdobeXD to Zeplin and provide to development team.
                    </li>
                    <li>Build. Component is built by developers and published to Storybook for testing and UI
                        verification.
                    </li>
                    <li>Verify. Through Storybook the test team verifies the component is working as expected, and
                        BackstopJS ensures no visual regression for existing components.</li>
                    <li>Sign off. Completed component is signed off by testers and UI team, and then becomes available
                        for
                        use by the wider development teams.</li>

                    With a design system locked in and a process in place, I pushed forward with painstakingly creating

                    their potential states (for example, :active, :hover, :disabled, :focus), which resulted in hundreds
                    of designs.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    My major goal for this project was to meet AA Web Accessibility Standards. As a modern business that
                    caters to the masses it's truly disgraceful that we weren't already meeting these basic web
                    standards. I advocated hard to include the requirement to meet AA standards in our design system
                    project. I was able to convince my manager and associate director of the value we would create, and
                    got the green light to build towards AA standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a business perspective meeting AA standards will always be a positive when working with our

                    In the past each team has handled developer handover differently, making the designers job more

                    guesswork and explicitly telling developers exactly which component to use.</mark>

                <h3>Facilitating UI testing </h3>

                <p>Another perk of the design system was its ability to facilitate UI testing through manual and
                    automated testing.</p>



                <h4>Automated testing</h4>
                <p>BackstopJS has been a godsend for the Component library. It completes <mark>automated visual regression
                    testing</mark> for UIs across configured devices and operating systems to prevent unintended changes being
                    pushed to the Component Library. This is significantly reduced the amount of UI sign off the design
                    team needs to complete, and removes us as a bottleneck to development of components.</p>

                <h4>Streamlining manual testing</h4>
                <p>Zeplin arms the manual test team with UI testing tools to compare the design to the built component
                    and identify gaps or mistakes before the component makes it to production. Screen overlay, detailed
                    specifications and versioning of designs means that <mark> manual testers can verify UIs on their own,
                    without waiting for UI designer sign off.</mark></p>

                <h2>The impact</h2>

                <p>
                    The work is never done, and the Design System will always be evolving. However, with strong
                    processes and controls in place, alongside better working processes that reduce the overhead for the
                    teams, this Design System is here to stay.
                </p>


                <h3>For the design team</h3>
                <p>We have a design system we can rely on. We have detailed component definitions built in AdobeXD that
                    directly connect to real components in Storybook, allowing us to prototype at speeds we were never
                    capable of before. We have a resource that facilitates discussions with the business, and a process
                    that allows us to gatekeep the design system to <mark>ensure that we spend our time building components
                    that genuinely deliver value.</mark>
                </p>


                <h3>For the development teams</h3>
                <p><mark>The Design System project has been a phenomenal success.</mark> Teams are seeing a huge return on investment
                    by migrating to the Component Library, and new apps are all slated to be built using the new design system.
                    Existing products are scheduling sprints to complete their upgrade as soon as possible, as the
                    benefits speak for themselves.</p>

                <h3>For the business</h3>
                <p>The business is starting to see a real return on investment as products migrate to the new library
                    and UI related bugs being to taper off. <mark> More technical work can be completed as teams no longer need
                    to worry about maintaining the UI, giving them more time to focus on the complex stuff.</mark>
